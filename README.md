# Memory Game

This is the game of Memory created in JavaScript for the Front-End Developer NanoDegree through Udacity by Kj Kilanski.

## Instructions For Playing

1. Open the game in a browser window
2. Click a card to view the card
3. Click a second card to see if it matches the first you selected
4. If the pair matches, they will remain open. If they do not match, they will flip back over.
5. Continue until you match all the cardShuffle

During the game, the number of moves and the amount of time are recorded. A star rating will be given based on the number of moves you make. Both the number of moves and your star rating are visible at the top of the screen.
At any point during play, you can restart the game by pressing the 'reload' button on the top right of the playing board.

When you finish the game, the final number of moves, amount of time, and the number of stars will be displayed. You can close the box using the 'x' at the top right of the screen to return to the game board. To reset the game and play again, you can press the 'Reset' button.

1. Shuffle() function - http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976
2. Timer functionality - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41632942/how-to-measure-time-elapsed-on-javascript

The shuffle() function was included in the starting code for the project.<br/>
The timer functionality is one I adapted from other code and updated based on my own needs and style.
